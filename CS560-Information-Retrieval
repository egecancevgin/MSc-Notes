Final Exam Notes:

Hard clustering puts each document into only one cluster, whereas soft clustering lets a document belong to many clusters.
Scatter-gather is an interactive way of clustering.
Standard inverted index has term and document table. e.g. mining -> D1, D2

Q1: Define two documents as similar and give an information need where the cluster hypothesis does not hold.
   IN: Find news about the US election.
   D1, a news article about Clinton and Sarkozy meeting on climate issues.
   D2, a news article about Clinton and Sarkozy at an international summit.

Q2: Give a 1D example with two clusters where cluster-based retrieval performs worset than nearest neighbor search.
   Q=5, Cluster A = {0, 1, 2}, luster B = {10, 11, 12}, and one document at position 4.
   Here, cluster-based retrieval picks A, missing the most relevant doc 4.
